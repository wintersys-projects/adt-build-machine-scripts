# Description : This is the script which will build a functioning webserver. It contains
# all the configuration settings and remote calls to the webserver we are building to ensure
# that it is built correctly and functions as it is supposed to.
# These scripts look more complicated than they really are. All that is happening is we are
# copying over some files to our new autoscaler and executing a few commands (mostly to
# install software) remotely on the autoscaler.
