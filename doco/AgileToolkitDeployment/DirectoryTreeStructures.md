On the build machine

```${BUILD_HOME}/builddescriptors/autoscalerscp.dat``` - the autoscaler relevant environment variables  
```${BUILD_HOME}/builddescriptors/databasescp.dat``` - the database relevant environment variables  
```${BUILD_HOME}/builddescriptors/webserverscp.dat``` - the webserver relevant environment variables   

```${BUILD_HOME}/builddescriptors/buildstyles.dat``` - configuration of different build methods for the tools we want to work with  

--------------------------------------------

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/ACTIVE_BUILD_IDENTIFIER``` - the currently active build identifier - user provider string    

```/${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/ACTIVE_CLOUDHOST``` - the currently active cloudhost - one of "digitalocean", "exoscale", "linode", "vultr"  

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/BUILD_MACHINE_CLOUDHOST``` - same as above but your build machine could be a different cloudhost to your main cloudhost. For example, you can run your build_machine on linode but be deploying to exoscale in which case the BUILD_MACHINE_CLOUDHOST would be different to your main cloudhost  

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/PRIME_FIREWALL``` - tells the firewalling system to prime itself  

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/${cloudhost}``` - this is a main directory and for builds for a particular cloudhost, digitalocean, exoscale, linode, vultr  

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/${cloudhost}/${build_identifier}``` - a directory for a particular build_identifier for a particular cloudhost  

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/${cloudhost}/${build_identifier}/APPLICATION:${application}``` - where application can be one of joomla, wordpress, drupal or moodle - this tells us which application has been or is being deployed for this particular cloudhost and build_identifier  

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/${cloudhost}/${build_identifier}/autoscaler_configuration_settings.dat``` - this is the autoscaler environment settings generated from the template and possibly user input. This file will be ssh copied to any autoscaler machine that is provisioned  

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/${cloudhost}/${build_identifier}/build_environment``` - this is a copy of the environment as it was immediately prior to the commencement of a build. It can be referre to to see what the system thinks things were set to and compared to what you think it should be set to  

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/${cloudhost}/${build_identifier}/CLOUDHOST:${cloudhost}``` - this is alread set in the directtory path and also in the ACTIVE_CLOUDHOST file but it is also recorded here for convenient access  

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/${cloudhost}/${build_identifier}/${configuration_file}``` - for example configration.php if we are deploying joomla or wp_config.php if we are deploying wordpress. We extract this file from the CMS system being deployed and configure it on the build machine with attributes like the database credentials and any other application configuration settings that we chose to modify. The configured file is then copied to the datastore and the websevers we deploy then look for it in the datastore, ready configured for our application and can simply get their own copy from the datastore and take it from there.  

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/${cloudhost}/${build_identifier}/credentials``` - this contains credentials such as server username and password as well as the ssh public key and public key id. The database credentials used to configure the application we are installing are also stored here.  

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/${cloudhost}/${build_identifier}/${build_identifier}``` - we already know the build_identifier from the directory path we are using, but, the build_identifier is stored here for easy access and if it is here it tells us that a build is actually in progress rather than just being prepared.   

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/${cloudhost}/${build_identifier}/CURRENTREGION``` - this tells us the current region for this particular build the region is build specific you could have a deployment to one region for one build_identifier and another deployment for another build_identifier  

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/${cloudhost}/${build_identifier}/database_configuration_settings.dat``` - this is the database server environment settings as generated from the template and possibly user input. This file will be ssh copied to any database machine that is being provisioned.   

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/${cloudhost}/${build_identifier}/dbp.dat``` - this is the application specific database prefix as obtained for the current application we are installing.  

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/${cloudhost}/${build_identifier}/EMERGENCY_PASSWORD``` - the linode deployments generate an emergency password for machine access through lish. The other providers don't generate an emergency password as part of the build process.  

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/${cloudhost}/${build_identifier}/INITIAL_BUILD_COMPLETED``` - the existence of this file tells us that a particular build_identifier has completed its initial build process we can check for this file to see how far we are into the build  

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/${cloudhost}/${build_identifier}/ips``` - this directory is used for storing ip addresses for easy access that have been generated by the build process such as database ip addresses.  

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/${cloudhost}/${build_identifier}/keys``` - this holds the private and public keys for our server machines. The public key can be copied to our servers as we build them and the private key can be used from here to authenticate to the servers. This directory also contains the keys generated during our ssh_keyscan of each new machine that is build. By using strict host checking we aren't risking being spoofed as often as we would be without using strict host checking.  

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/${cloudhost}/${build_identifier}/${cloudhost}${template_no}.tmpl``` this is a copy of the template that we are building from and tells us how we want our servers arranged.  

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/${cloudhost}/${build_identifier}/logs``` - this is where error and output stream logs are stored for a build  

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/${cloudhost}/${build_identifier}/ssl``` - the ssl certificates that we want to install on our webservers are stored here we can ssh copy them from here to our webserver and also the datastore for easy access by our webservers. They are checked for expiration as part of the build process.  

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/${cloudhost}/${build_identifier}/TOKEN``` -this is the api token for our current cloudhost. It is kept here for easy access.  

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/${cloudhost}/${build_identifier}/VPC_ACTIVE``` - this is a placeholder file and if it is here then it means that our build_machine is operating from within the same VPC as our server machines are.  

```${BUILD_HOME}/runtimedata/${cloudhost}/${build_identifier}/webserver_configuration_settings.dat``` - this is the webserver environment settings as generated from the template and possibly user input. This file will be ssh copied to any webserver machine that is being provisioned.
