#### Adding a new application to the toolkit

The core supports joomla,wordpress,drupal and moodle. If you want to support further applications such as "NextCloud" and a whole host of other potential applications I believe you should be able to integrate support for any (php) application which follows a similar pattern by updating and modifying files in these directories or in the case of specific files particular files themselves.

The most major part of the integration is likely to be adt-webserver-scripts/providerscripts/webserver/configuration and will most likely take the majority of your effort
