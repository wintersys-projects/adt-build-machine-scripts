# Description: This script will check for assets that have been stored in a particular
# datastore bucket from previous application deployments. If we are deploying a new
# baseline that wants to use the same bucket as a previous application has used then
# the baseline will overwrite any assets previously stored so we need to check with the
# user that they are OK with this and they intend it. This script will make a backup
# of the assets in the bucket to be overwritten as a safety measure which may take a bit
# of time depending on the size of the bucket. In truth this most likely won't happen
# in regular use but in testing it happened quite a lot which is why I could see that
# a check was needed.
