# Description : For operational reasons we need to have the build identifier available
# before we read the template this is not a problme when we are hardcore but when we
# are expedited we need to have the BUILD_IDENTIFIER available up front.
# The easiest way to do this is just to ask the user interactively to input a value 
# for a build identifier and make it clear to them that it will override and overwrite
# any setting that they have previously held in their template.
