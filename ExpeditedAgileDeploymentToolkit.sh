# Description: This is the main script that is called every time there is a build happening using
# the Agile Deployment Toolkit
# Author Peter Winter
# Date 22/9/2020
##############################################################################################
# This is the Expedited Agile Deployment toolkit. It REQUIRES a configuration template which has ALL 
# the necessary parameters populated within it templates for each cloudhost are stored under 
# ${BUILD_HOME}/templatedconfigurations/<yourcloudhost>/<yourcloudhost>[n].tmpl
# ALL of the configuration parameters must be sane and correct and without errors for a build to complete correctly
# There's a two ways you can run a build process the expedited way and the hardcore way. You can find out more about
# these in the wiki of this repository.
# This program can be called from cloud-init (a HARDCORE build) or started from the command line (an EXPEDITED build).
# You can pass a small set of parameters from the command line or enter then interactively.
