# Description: This is the the expedited version of the top level build script for the 
# Agile Deployment Toolkit.
# Author Peter Winter
# Date 22/9/2020
##############################################################################################
#This is the Expedited Agile Deployment toolkit. It REQUIRES a configuration template which has ALL 
#the necessary parameters populated within it templates for each cloudhost are stored under 
#${BUILD_HOME}/templatedconfigurations/<yourcloudhost>/<yourcloudhost>[n].tmpl
#You can create a new template for selection by naming it 
#${BUILD_HOME}/templatedconfigurations/<yourcloudhost>/<yourcloudhost>[n+1].tmpl
#ALL of the configuration parameters must be sane and correct and without errors for a build to complete correctly
#There's a two ways you can run a build process the expedited way and the hardcore way. You can find out more about
#these in the wiki of this repository.
