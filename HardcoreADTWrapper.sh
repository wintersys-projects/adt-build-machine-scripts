# Description: This is just a wrapper which adjusts the SSH connection timeouts so that connections 
# are not dropped during the build. Correct me if I am wrong, but, the new SSH settings are picked up
# when a new shell is started as in /bin/sh ExpeditedAgileDeploymentToolkit.sh
# This script needs to be called from a cloud-init script or from a StackScript if you are running
# on Linode when a build machine is provisioned for a hardcore build process
# Agile Deployment Toolkit.
